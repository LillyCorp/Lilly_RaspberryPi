cd pyaudio

sudo python setup.py install

test.py This is for recording something from the mic

fft.py This is to perform FFT on the wav file



The approach would be as follow

1)Obtain the Audio Input
2)Do FFT over the Audio Input 
3)FFT will return a 2D matrix of
X axis -Time
Y axis -Freq
Z axis -Amplitude which most likely would be Complex 

4)Find the mean of the FFT for different data sets.
  I came  across this on stack overflow .They use this technique for classifying music into gener's.

  So the idea is say rock music which has primarily Bass as the the frequncy range with max amplitude .
  Now when you subtract the mean from the data set corresponding to that of Rock , it will yield primarily in the frequency range of that of Bass.Now using a good classifier like SVM we can easily segregate this into groups.

  I assume that this could be extended to the problem at hand .
